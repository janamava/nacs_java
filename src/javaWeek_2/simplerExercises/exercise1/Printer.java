/*
A Printer can print an article, which means it just writes the title and the text on the screen.

exercise 5
Reuse the Printer from exercise 1 (donâ€™t copy it, reuse the existing one from the package where it already is).
Add the new method printMagazine to the Printer that receives a Magazine
and displays its title and then all the articles.
