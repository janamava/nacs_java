/*
Derek has a tool as attribute, but he does not receive it through the constructor.
Instead he receives it with a setTool method. He also has the methods canHangPainting and hangPainting.

In the canHangPainting Derek checks if he has a tool called hammer. If so he returns true, otherwise false.

In the hangPainting method, if Derek canHangPainting it will say he can hang the painting.
Otherwise he will say that heâ€™s missing the hammer.
