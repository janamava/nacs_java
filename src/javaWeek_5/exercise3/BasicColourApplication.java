/*


Create a list of Shape called shapes and add rectangle and shape to it. Note that you cannot add colored because itâ€™s not a Shape object.
Add the toString method to the Rectangle. Make sure you use its interface methods to return its color and name as a String. Display the three lists


Color: violet
Name: rectangle
Colored: violet
Shape: rectangle
[violet rectangle]
[violet rectangle, violet rectangle]
[violet rectangle, violet rectangle]
